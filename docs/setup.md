Setup the development environment
=================================

To set up the development environment, you will need to install __pyenv__ on your computer. You can find installation instruction at [https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation).

When __pyenv__ is installed, you can run `make setup` to configure the Python environment for this project, including development tools and dependencies.

Additionally, you will need to install __speccy__ for building specific services. __Speccy__ is used to merge OpenAPI definitions together for API Gateway. You can find installation instruction at [https://github.com/wework/speccy#setup](https://github.com/wework/speccy#setup).
